# coainventory

This is a django application that I built for use at work. I work in IT as a desktop support specialist and part of my duties is to keep an inventory of our computers, printers, and servers. I had a difficult time finding a solution that would work for us in our price range (free) so I decided I would put my newly minted django skills to the test. I am working towards making this an application that can be downloaded and used as open source, but I'm not quite there yet.
